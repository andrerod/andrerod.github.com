As you may be aware, Microsoft has been investing into making Azure a great platform for any language and platform you'd like to use to build your application.  
With last year's [Spring release](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/06/07/meet-the-new-windows-azure.aspx) Azure started to offer a [Cross Platform CLI](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/downloads/) that brings to the mac and linux worlds what you could already achieve through Powershell on Windows. With it, it also started to offer official SDKs in a variety of different languages:
* [Node.js](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/)
* [Java](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/java/)
* [PHP](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/php/)
* [Python](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/python/)

And as of last Friday, 26th of April 2013, also support for [Ruby](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/ruby/).

In this initial release, the Ruby SDK includes support for storage services (blob, table and queues), as well as, for service bus. The team will be adding more and more services in the near future.

Hope you enjoy using it just as much as we enjoyed creating it.
