Another year came by, and a new edition of [LXJS](http://2013.lxjs.org/) came with it. This was the second time this conference was organized and it's exciting to see the conference evolve and have a second edition with even more attendees than the first one. [Nuno Jobs](https://github.com/dscape) and [Pedro Teixeira](https://twitter.com/pedrogteixeira), the conference benevolent founders, certainly were [pleasently surprised](http://metaduck.com/10-lxjs-2013.html) by it. :)

Like in the previous year, one of the key points of the conference was that no one had as a goal to make a profit out of it and, without even knowing the exact value as things still settle down, it is clear that goal was achieved with us using just about as much money as we have received in making sure we had a great conference, with a [great venue](http://www.cinemasaojorge.pt/apresentacao.php), [great speakers](http://2013.lxjs.org/speakers/) and, last but not least, some great parties that give the chance to everyone that attended the conference to spend some time together, exchange contacts and discuss new ideas. 

While some things could have gone better - the projector on the first day most noticeable - we tried to improve on the lessons learned from last year - on the Wifi for instance - and also keep some of the winning strategies as were the boat party, the amount of international speakers and the [pasteis de nata](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastel_de_nata). :)
Overall, and even though we're still going through the postmortem both internally within the team and externaly, it is very rewarding to be getting very good overall [feedback](http://danielcsgomes.com/events/lxjs-2013-was-awesome/#.UnWp0ZQRC4Y).

All in all, it was an amazing experience and I hope we can all be a part of it again next year :)
